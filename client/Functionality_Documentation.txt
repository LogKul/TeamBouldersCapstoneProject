All pages route from the base page.

Local access via NPM: localhost:3000
Web access: https://playcheckersnow.com





-----------------
All pages:
-----------------

All pages contain a navigation bar located at the top of the page and a footer bar located at the
bottom of the page. The navigation bar redirects differently if the user is logged in/out.

While logged out, all links redirect the user to the login page except for the home link which
redirects the user to the base page.

While logged in, the navigation bar functions from left to right as follows:

Home (Checkers icon - redirects to Home page),
Play Game (redirects to Play page),
Leaderboard (redirects to Leaderboard page),
Game History (redirects to Recordings page),
Account (redirects to Account page),
LOGOUT (redirects to base page and removes stored access token)

Once a user is logged in, they are given an access token which will automatically refresh every
2 minutes. If the access token expires or a user closes the site, they will need to log in again.






-----------------
Base page:
-----------------

The base page is the first page a user will see when accessing the site. It exists at the base
URL of the site which can be found at the top of this document.

Before a user can access any other pages on the website, besides Login and Signup, they must create
and/or log in to an account.

Attempting to access any links on the base page will redirect the user to the Login page.

Once a user is logged in, they can access the base page again via URL but access tokens are
stored locally per session, so clicking any links from the base page will redirect the user
without prompting them to log in again. Additionally, because access tokens are stored per session,
once the site is closed, the user must log in again.

The base page includes a 'Login' button, a 'Features' section which indicates some of the primary
features of the site, and a 'Current Leaderboards' section which shows the current player rankings.








-----------------
Login page:
-----------------

The Login page uses 2 fields for authentication: Username and Password

Once a username and password is submitted by clicking the 'Sign In' button, the field information
is authenticated against the database. Either the user is logged in and redirected to the Home page,
or an error message is displayed.

Error messages display on the screen when an error occurs with login to indicate to the user of
invalid credentials, missing field values, or connectivity to the server.

An additional 'Sign Up' button is included in the Login page which redirects the user to the
Register page.








-----------------
Register page:
-----------------

The Register page uses 3 fields to create an account: Username, Password, and Confirm Password

Once a username, password, and confirmed password is submitted by clicking the 'Submit' button, the
field information is validated against the database. Upon successful account creation, a modal
pops up to indicate to the user the account was successfully created which includes two buttons:
'Sign In' which redirects to the Login page and 'Close' which closes the modal showing the Register
page. Upon unsuccessful account creation, an error message is displayed indicating the reason the
account was not created.

Account creation criteria:
A username must not exist in the database and passwords must meet specific conditions.

1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 special character, 1 number, and 8-24 characters in length

The confirm password field must match the initial password.

Error messages regarding password criteria are indicated to the user while the password fields are
active and until the criteria is met. The validity of the password is indicated to the user in
realtime.

The Register page also includes a 'Sign In' button which if clicked redirects the user to the Login
page.

Losses, and W/L Ratio).








-----------------
Account page:
-----------------

The accounge page includes 2 buttons:

'Update Password' opens a modal containing 1 field for the user to input a new password. Once the
new password is submitted by clicking the 'Submit' button, the new password is updated in the
database and a success message is shown on the account page. There are no error messages that
display in the password update page; however, error messages will show up in the the console log.
The success message also contains a link to return 'Home'.

Your Game Recordings (redirects to Recordings page specific to the user)

The account page also contains stat information specific to the player (MMR, Wins, Losses, and W/L
Ratio).





-----------------
Recordings page:
-----------------

The Recordings page when accessed via 'Game History' in the navigation bar, lists all the games
played by all players.

Each players name can be clicked which will redirect to the Recordings page specific to the
username clicked.

Recordings pages specific to a username include only games that user has played.

Game information displayed includes Time Finished, Winner, Red Player, and Black Player.






-----------------

-----------------

The Leaderboard page lists all the players in order by their rank where 1st is the highest rank.

Included for each player record is their username, MMR, Winrate (W/L Ratio), Wins, and Losses.

Each players name can be clicked which will redirect to the Recordings page specific to the

-----------------
Play page:
-----------------

The Play page includes 2 buttons:

Offline Against AI (redirects to Game page)
PVP Online (redirects to Matchmaking page)

Features of gameplay are shown under each button which describe what the player can expect when
they choose between playing AI or Online.






-----------------
Game page:
-----------------

The Game page initially displays a modal for the player to choose their color. This is done with 2
buttons labelled accordingly 'Play as Red' and 'Play as Black'. If the 'Close' button is clicked,
the modal will close and a button 'Choose Color' will be shown which, if clicked, will reopen the
modal for the player to choose their color.

After choosing a color, the Checkers game engine runs and begins the game with the player playing
as their chosen color.

indicated the reason the player has won or lost. 3 buttons are shown in the modal:

Play Another (redirects to the Play page)
Return Home (redirects to the Home page)

'Close' button closes the modal and shows a message indicating whether the player won or lost.






-----------------
Matchmaking page:
-----------------

The Matchmaking page initially searches for an open game for the player to join. If no games exist,
a game is created and the player is put into a pairing queue while they wait for another player to
join. If a game does exist, the player joins the game and waits for the Checkers game engine to run.
A message indicates when the player is searching for a game and a seperate message indicates when
the player is waiting for another player to join the game. When joining a game, both players are
randomly given a color.

After 2 players have joined a game, the Checkers game engine runs with each player playing as their
randomly generated color.

After the game ends, a modal is displayed that indicates if the player has won or lost. It is also
indicated the reason the player has won or lost. 3 buttons are shown in the modal:
