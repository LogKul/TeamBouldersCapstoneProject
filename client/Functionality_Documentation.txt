===========================

All pages route from the base page.

Local access via NPM: localhost:3000
Web access: https://playcheckersnow.com



-----------------
All pages:
-----------------

All pages contain a navigation bar located at the top of the page and a footer bar located at the
bottom of the page. The navigation bar redirects differently if the user is logged in/out.

While logged out, all links redirect the user to the login page except for the home link which
redirects the user to the base page.

While logged in, the navigation bar functions from left to right as follows:

Home (Checkers icon - redirects to Home page),
Play Game (redirects to Play page),
Leaderboard (redirects to Leaderboard page),
Recording (redirects to Recordings page),
Account (redirects to Account page),
LOGOUT (redirects to base page)

Once a user is logged in, they are given an access token which will automatically refresh every
2 minutes. If the access token expires or a user closes the site, they will need to log in again.






-----------------
Base page:
-----------------

The base page is the first page a user will see when accessing the site. It exists at the base
URL of the site which can be found at the top of this document.

Before a user can access any other pages on the website, besides Login and Signup, they must create
and/or log in to an account.

Attempting to access any links on the base page will redirect the user to the Login page.

Once a user is logged in, they can access the base page again via URL but access tokens are
stored locally per session, so clicking any links from the base page will redirect the user
without prompting them to log in again. Additionally, because access tokens are stored per session,
once the site is closed, the user must log in again.

The base page includes a 'Login' button, a 'Features' section which indicates some of the primary
features of the site, and a 'Current Leaderboards' section which shows the current player rankings.








-----------------
Login page:
-----------------

The Login page uses 2 fields for authentication: Username and Password

Once a username and password is submitted by clicking the 'Sign In' button, the field information
is authenticated against the database. Either the user is logged in and redirected to the Home page,
or an error message is displayed.

Error messages display on the screen when an error occurs with login to indicate to the user of
invalid credentials, missing field values, or connectivity to the server.

An additional 'Sign Up' button is included in the Login page which redirects the user to the
Register page.








-----------------
Register page:
-----------------

The Register page uses 3 fields to create an account: Username, Password, and Confirm Password

Once a username, password, and confirmed password is submitted by clicking the 'Submit' button, the
field information is validated against the database. Upon successful account creation, a modal
pops up to indicate to the user the account was successfully created which includes two buttons:
'Sign In' which redirects to the Login page and 'Close' which closes the modal showing the Register
page. Upon unsuccessful account creation, an error message is displayed indicating the reason the
account was not created.

Account creation criteria:
A username must not exist in the database and passwords must meet specific conditions.

1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 special character, 1 number, and 8-24 characters in length

The confirm password field must match the initial password.

Error messages regarding password criteria are indicated to the user while the password fields are
active and until the criteria is met. The validity of the password is indicated to the user in
realtime.

The Register page also includes a 'Sign In' button which if clicked redirects the user to the Login
page.
